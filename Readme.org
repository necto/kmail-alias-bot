* A simple Telegram bot to facilitate creation of e-mail aliases in Infomaniak's kMail

** Planned features
- [ ] Get the kMail and the Telegram API tokens from a config file, and other
  parameters, like the account id and/or domain name.
- [ ] Get the owner TG handle from a config file, and communicate only with the
  owner.
- [ ] ~/add~ command to create an alias
  - Accepts alias name (before '@' part) description (purpose)
  - In addition to creating the alias, also sends a test e-mail to the newly
    created address, with the provided description. this surves a double purpose of
    documenting the alias itself
- [X] ~/list~ command to list all the aliases
- [ ] ~/remove~ command to remove an alias
- [ ] A docker container and a sample docker-compose file to conveniently deploy
  the bot on a NAS container station.
